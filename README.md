## FAQ

### What is the Epsilon Class and why is it important?
Well, none of PSL is important, but heres why it is distinctly different from the main branch of PSL:

Firstly, it may be confusing to read or operate. It's not going to be cleaned for viewers, optimized, have cool flight modes, stability, or any of that. Think more towards properly blending elevons to maximize low speed high AoA flight for my foamboard airplane. Problems arise quickly, as you don't have my plane, you don't have the same goals, and you most definitely not interested. It's meant more to explore further flight possibilities than anything else.

### What are you going to focus on first?
Probably elevon blending with flaperons in a two-piece flaperon. Trying to go for stol aircraft with the maximum control possible at the lowest airspeed possible.
