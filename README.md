# Project Lynx
-- RPi powered R/C Flight Control System --

# What is Project Lynx?
Project Lynx(PL) is currently a Raspberry Pi Pico based Flight Control system aimed to provide modes for 3-axis stabilization, data logging, flight control surface blending, and more.

# Why Project Lynx? Why not commercially available 3-axis gyros?
	Well, for one, why not?
	
	I got bored in my Latin Class, and started browsing options for R/C Aircraft systems. I found many were available, only at steep prices(or for more affordable options, like the Omnibus F4, no stock).
