# FAQ
### What is Project Lynx?
Project Lynx(PL) is currently a Raspberry Pi Pico based Flight Control system aimed to provide modes for 3-axis stabilization, data logging, flight control surface blending, and more.

### Why Project Lynx? Why not commercially available 3-axis gyros?
Well, for one, why not?

I got bored in my Latin Class, and started browsing options for R/C Aircraft systems. I found many were available, only at steep prices(or for more affordable options, like the Omnibus F4, no stock).
	
I'm a maker, why not make it myself? And so I will! The ability to specifically tailor this FCS to my aircraft and model the FCS to operate it as best as it can is something only custom projects could provide. Consumer Flight Controllers are great, and certainly don't let me discourage you from buying one(<sub>as if I was discouraging anyone to begin with</sub>). This is simply a project to build my skills as a budding Aerospace Engineer and make my R/C aircraft the best aircraft available.

### What does this require?
Electronics, soldering iron, all that, but most importantly:
***Time.***

More to the elctronics bit, heres the Bill of Materials so far(this includes base components for the R/C airplane):
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Silicone-wrapped wire(22AWG should be fine)
- Servos(cheap 9g are fine, don't go above ~6 servos without more amps on the BEC. 5v from the USB **will not** power more than 2 servos alone.)
- Servo Extensions(For ease of unplugging servos, and more importantly soldering connectors to the board)
- 50uF Capacitor
- 100uF Capacitor
- ESCs, with BEC 5v at 5A is recommended
- Probably LEDs of some sort, a more accurate list will follow later.

### Are you even qualified? Who even are you?
Great question! I often ask that myself

The answer is no, not explicitly qualified. But I am certainly motivated. I can code, I can fly, and I can combine the two. 

I am in High School and pursuing a career path in Aerospace Engineering or Computer Science, all of which is based on my hobbies and general interest. 

### What pace are you going at? How soon will this be ready to fly?
Ideally first static tests of the stability system by mid-April 2023. Passive carry by early to mid April as well. I will know more by then.
